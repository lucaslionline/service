As a mean of supporting teams' sponsorship development, the Organizing Committee would like to offer teams' sponsors free exhibition booths in the [Super Tent Expo Area](#super-tent) during the competition period. To help the Committee plan the exhibition events, here is requesting teams' up to date sponsoring information. Please fill out the attached [Team Sponsor Directory](#file) and send us back by `August 15th`. Please keep us updated about this form. Thank you!

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact.

Sincerely,
